<h1>Security Camera HTML</h1>
<h3>Bootstrap, Lightbox2</h3>

I have created a self contained webpage in order to show the current feed from the cameras.

It currently loads and image from each camera every .3 seconds and when you click on a particular image it will load the fill video feed.

This is used mainly to watch the cameras not to record or edit snapshots.

Tested and working IP Cameras:

- Foscam
- Axis
